						<p>AI has without a doubt been the hottest thing in the tech space for the past few years and its 
							growth in power and controversy has only accelerated. In 2020 Chat GPT amazed the world with its 
							ability to converse with humans and just 4 years later AI generated art is winning competitions 
							in major artistic fields. The 2020s AI space-race is in full-swing as every major company from 
							Google to Amazon search for new ways to monetise and monopolize AI, and the trend right now is 
							art.</p>

						<p>So what can this technology actually be used for? How does it affect the world of art? How does
							it affect the real people who work in art? How does it even work, are there ethical or legal
							implications? Is it even necessary? And what does it mean for the human spirit of creativity?
							Read on to explore all of these questions and more!</p>

						<p>As it is a widely contentious issue, AI art has both supporters and detractors. Due to its online
							nature, most of the supporters have come from places like Twitter and Reddit with the most
							common  positive sited being the democratization of art. Through use of AI technology anyone 
							can become an amazing artist and reap all the mental health benefits that come with it, or so they
							say. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>Another way it improves accessibility is through cost. AI art can be created by anyone with internet
						   access with the largest barrier to entry being purchase of "credits" or a subscription which generally
						   don't cost too much.

						<p>The other most common angle from proponents of the technology is efficiency. What would normally take
							a human many hours can be accomplished by AI software in seconds or minutes. This can be useful for
							gathering inspiration for your own creations or for getting quick feedback from a client, but can
							also be used to create promotional images or assets in a much shorter amount of time. </p>

						<p>From the other side of the aisle the main complaint about AI art is very clear: the loss of jobs. 
							Many people spend their whole lives training and practicing their craft to get jobs they love, 
							and now those jobs are being taken by pieces of software. Not only are their jobs being stolen 
							but also their work. AI art technology needs to be trained to create its art and that means 
							feeding it pre-existing art, often without the creator's consent.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="gap"></div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>There are also concerns about the quality of the work. As the technology is still being 
							developed, the quality of work it produces is often below standard and can contain uncanny 
							defects like incorrect number of fingers and other details a human artist would simply not 
							get wrong.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The issue of the technology being used for evil is also a pressing one. Yes, AI art might let 
							anyone be an artist, but is that necessarily a good thing? What are the risks of realistic 
							misleading or slanderous images and videos being produced on-mass by people who would otherwise 
							have no avenue of doing so?</p>

						<p>Lastly, we come to the endgame of the technology, can AI really produce infinite images and 
							videos with no repercussions at all? If this technology can produce art far faster than any 
							human but also needs increasingly more data to create art, what happens once it starts training 
							off its own art?</p>
						<br>
						<p>And on a more philosophical note, what does it really mean to be “creative”? Is art just another 
							cog in the wheel of the increasingly capitalistic, for-profit society we live in or is it 
							something fundamental to the human experience? Is sacrificing the human element of art really 
							worth it to increase the size of the wealthiest peoples pockets even more?</p>

						<p>In conclusion, the world of AI art is still in its infancy and the way we as consumers respond 
							to it and the way its developed will change its impact on the industry and creativity itself. 
							Its important to remember that anywhere AI art is used is a place a real humans experience 
							and passion for art could have also been used, yes it can be used to supplement this but should 
							it entirely replace it?</p>
