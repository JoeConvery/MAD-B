							In a time like the one we live in, where the wealth disparity is growing, jobs are increasingly 
							hard to come by, and the cost of living keeps increasing, nobody wants to lose their livelyhood 
							to a machine. AI art algorithms taking jobs however is particularly vexxing as these are jobs 
							people love. Cashiers will morn their loss of income but probably not their job, and this could 
							be solved with better economic policies like UBI, but artists live for their craft. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							In 2022 a participant won the Colorado State Fair's art competition with a piece of AI art. 
							Not only did this take the prize money from someone who put real effort and dedication into 
							their work, it also took any recognition and further work that they might have gained from 
							winning the title.

							The other participants weren't the only people this winner stole from however. "Midjourney" was the 
							program used to generate the image, so any pieces of art this AI model scraped to train and create 
							the winning piece have also been stolen from.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Legally, whether AI art counts as theft is still being worked out in the courts, but the public 
							consensus does seem in favour of it being so. This was given a bump in support when people 
							started discovering what appeared to be signatures in pieces of AI generated art. Even if this 
							is just the AI immitating sigantures, it still proves that it has been fed signed work and it 
							seems doubtful that the creator of such works would do this willingly.
