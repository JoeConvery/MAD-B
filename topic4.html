							The “Death Spiral” of AI is a popular theory as to how AI generated art will progress in the 
							future. The idea goes that because these algorithms scrape the internet for art to use as 
							training data, what if when they start training off themselves, their errors and inconsistencies 
							multiply until ultimately the output is useless for its intended purpose.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							A study on this phenomenon was carried out by reasearchers from top universities in the UK and their 
							results showed that a continuous cycle of this recursive behavious evnetually causes a total "model collapse".

							Usually technology is created to solve a problem, so what problem does AI art actually solve? 
							Is the joy of art not to create something with your own hands and for other people to be able 
							to experience the story or emotion you've expressed through it? AI art is the product of 
							imitating other pieces of art its seen to fulfil a prompt, it can't be exact in how it imitates 
							or what emotion comes through when it does.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Additionally, is it even fair to say AI art is "creative" in the first place? Margaret Boden, 
							a cognitive science expert, posits two types of creativity: "p-type", when a person has an idea 
							for the first time, and "h-type", when an idea is conceived for the very first time. Because of 
							how AI art is trained, it doesn't meet either of these critera, it simply borrows and morphs 
							previous ideas together.
